I'm a **Producer** and **Chief Creative Officer** who loves theme-driven design and creative teamwork. What does that mean? I love working with teams of talented people to make stuff. I especially love mixing highly creative challenges with the right technical solutions to get a creative vision on the screen. 

I'm particularly proud of the teamwork that lead to my **Academy Award-Nomination** for Best Visual Effects for **Solo: A Star Wars Story**. [I wrote a book](/2019/04/making-solo-a-star-wars-story/) about the production of that film and had a great experience working with Ron Howard and the entire team on that show as overall VFX Supervisor and Co-Producer. 

I served as Producer on the Disney+ series Willow, and I wrote and directed Lucasfilm’s first story-based virtual reality experiment [Trials on Tatooine](/2016/03/trials-on-tatooine/). I've worked on films dating back to **Independence Day**. Most recently, I enjoyed serving as Producer on the highly rated [**Star Wars: The Acolyte**](/2024/06/the-acolyte-s1-first-reviews/) with **Leslye Headland** and another steller team.

I currently serve as Chief Creative Officer of [Industrial Light & Magic](https://ilm.com/) and as SVP, Creative Innovation for [Lucasfilm](https://lucsfilm.com/).
