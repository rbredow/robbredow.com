Hi. I'm a **Producer**, **Chief Creative Officer**, and **Academy Award Nominated VFX Supervisor** who loves [**theme-driven design**](/2018/08/on-creativity-theme-driven-design/) and **creative teamwork**. I love working with teams of talented people to tell stories.

I'm particularly proud of the teamwork that lead to the **Academy Award-Nominated** VFX for **Solo: A Star Wars Story**. [I wrote a book](/2019/04/making-solo-a-star-wars-story/) about the production of that film and had a great experience working with Ron Howard and the entire team on that show. I was the overall VFX Supervisor and Co-Producer. 

I most recently served as Producer on the highly rated [**Star Wars: The Acolyte**](/2024/06/the-acolyte-s1-first-reviews/) with **Leslye Headland** and another steller team. I also Produced on the Disney+ series [Willow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10278918/), and I wrote and directed Lucasfilmâ€™s first story-based virtual reality experiment [Trials on Tatooine](/2016/03/trials-on-tatooine/). I've worked on a number of other films dating back to **Independence Day**.

I currently serve as Chief Creative Officer of [Industrial Light & Magic](https://ilm.com/) and as SVP, Creative Innovation for [Lucasfilm](https://lucasfilm.com/).
