Hi. I'm a **Producer** and **Chief Creative Officer** who loves theme-driven design and creative teamwork. What does that mean? I love working with teams of talented people to make stuff. [Theme-driven design](/2018/08/on-creativity-theme-driven-design/) is the only way I know to lead large creative teams. You set the context and don't micromanage. It's a great way to manage large projects like the ones I get to work on.

I'm particularly proud of the teamwork that lead to my **Academy Award-Nomination** for Best Visual Effects for **Solo: A Star Wars Story**. [I wrote a book](/2019/04/making-solo-a-star-wars-story/) about the production of that film and had a great experience working with Ron Howard and the entire team on that show as overall VFX Supervisor and Co-Producer. 

I most recently enjoyed serving as Producer on the highly rated [**Star Wars: The Acolyte**](/2024/06/the-acolyte-s1-first-reviews/) with **Leslye Headland** and another steller team. I served as Producer on the Disney+ series Willow, and I wrote and directed Lucasfilmâ€™s first story-based virtual reality experiment [Trials on Tatooine](/2016/03/trials-on-tatooine/). I've worked on films dating back to **Independence Day**.

I currently serve as Chief Creative Officer of [Industrial Light & Magic](https://ilm.com/) and as SVP, Creative Innovation for [Lucasfilm](https://lucasfilm.com/).
