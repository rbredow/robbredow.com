In 2000, I was invited to help teach a Siggraph session on Renderman. I was able to present the work of many people at Sony Imageworks who helped bring our furry hero to life. **Stuart Little** was the first CG  character to lead in a live-action movie, and there were plenty of things to work out to make it possible. In addition to the fur detailed below, there was a lot of effort put into the simulation of his clothing and just about every other aspect of the character. 

The show was led by Sr VFX Supervisor John Dykstra, and VFX Supervisor Jerome Chen. I learned a ton on this film and was very honored to get to present these notes in the SIGGRAPH Renderman course that year.

The majority of the development of the fur technology for Stuart Little was performed by Clint Hanson and Armin Bruderlin.
