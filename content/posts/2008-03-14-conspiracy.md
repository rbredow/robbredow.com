Pink Floyd released the “Take in Back” music video in 1994. I worked long hours on [one shot](/floyd.html) in the video for two weeks, laying it off to tape only minutes before our producer had to board a red-eye flight to Florida for the editing session the next morning.

12 years later I received this email with this image and the following message:

> Hi,  
> I am a life-long fan of Pink Floyd and recently stumbled onto your [webpage](<http://www.185vfx.com/floyd.html >). I would be most grateful if you could comment on the attached image. It is a still frame which reveals some embedded imagery. Why that specific symbol?

I seem to get 1 or two of these questions a year from Pink Floyd fans and followers mostly pertaining to the symbols hidden in the video. I enjoy trying to remember the specifics. “Who was it exactly who asked you to add the symbols to the rocks in the road as they were being ripped up by the tornado?”

I think the director (was his name Mark?) dropped the photos on my desk to be scanned and hidden in the rocks. I’m guessing those photos might be worth something if only I had thought to keep them.
