title: Great Failed Ideas in Production

Planning to attend [Siggraph](http://www.siggraph.org/s2008/) next week? I’m organizing an interesting panel to discuss some great ideas that just didn’t work out in production, presented by some of the best in the business:

> The stories behind the award-winning pictures that almost didn’t make it to the big screen. It’s often said that we learn more from our failures than our successes, yet we generally only share our success stories in the context of SIGGRAPH. This session gathers respected industry veterans to discuss great ideas that “failed” during the stress of real-world production.

The panelists include

 * John Dykstra (“Star Wars,” “Batman Forever,” “Spiderman”)  
 * John Knoll (“Star Wars,” Pirates of the Caribbean”) — Industrial Light &amp; Magic  
 * Apurva Shah (“Ratatouille,” “Nemo,” “Toy Story 3”) — Pixar Animation Studios  
 * Bill Westenhofer (“Golden Compass,” “Narnia”) — Rhythm &amp; Hues

**Edit from the future (2024):** Asking industry luminaries to talk about their *failures* seemed a bit risky at the time, but fun. In the end, it's one of the things that started my friendship with John Knoll and helped lead to my future job at Industrial Light & Magic. Life's interesting that way!
