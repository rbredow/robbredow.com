We got this awesome email from Chris and Phil this week. It really captures the spirit of working with them:

> To our incredible crew of geniuses: We made a really ridiculous movie together. We were able to get away with so much gorgeous, glorious, weirdness, and that as a result, we were showered with more success than anyone dared expect. And now, we have earned the most legendary honor a movie can get: an Oscar snub. The imprint of a true original. A rebel.

>But if you’re feeling a little disappointed, remember that we didn’t make this film together so it would be nominated for an Academy Award. We made it so that westbound United Airlines passengers would have something with which to temporarily divert themselves. And we succeeded. We also had an unforgettable experience making great art together, art which made a lot of people laugh, think, and not buy needless items from the skymall catalog.

>Congratulations and a lifelong thank you to all of you for making a warm, strange, sweet, smart, hilarious funny cartoon film. We are very very very proud.

>Love,  
>Chris and Phil!
