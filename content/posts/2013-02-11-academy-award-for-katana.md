This weekend the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Steve LaVietes, Jeremy Selen and Brian Hall an Academy Award for their work on Imageworkâ€™s Katana. Not surprisingly, it was a fantastic night.

Even the drive to the Beverly Hills Hotel was beautiful.

AMPAS knows how to put on a nice show.

Hosting the evening were Zoe Saldana And Chris Pine who handled the most challenging duties of the night: reading the technical descriptions for each of the awards. Everyone was thrilled to be getting awards from the cast of Star Trek.

Steve, Brian and Jeremy gave a terrific acceptance speech and even the crutches were only a minor challenge.

A really fun night.
