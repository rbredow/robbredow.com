Disney's D23 this year in Anaheim, CA was a blast. After several years of hoping to be able to put our guests into Star Wars, we were able to build a [StageCraft LED Volume](https://www.ilm.com/stagecraft-premiere-d23/) on the show floor.

Loved the interactions with the fans and seeing all the great cosplay. One of my favorites is pictured here on the right, Jedi Sully.

For more details and stories from the show I recommend this coverage from [Coffee With Kenobi](https://www.jedinews.com/podcasts/articles/coffee-with-kenobi-782-3-d23-day-two-and-day-three/) where Dan chats with me and provides audio coverage of the StageCraft presentation from the show floor.
