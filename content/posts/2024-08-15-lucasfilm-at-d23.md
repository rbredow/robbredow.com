Disney holds an event every other year for fans called D23 and this year's was held in Anaheim, CA. After several years of hoping to be able to put our guests into Star Wars, we were able to build a [StageCraft LED Volume](https://www.ilm.com/stagecraft-premiere-d23/) on the show floor for everyone to enjoy and it was a lot of fun.

I loved the interactions with the fans and seeing all the great cosplay. One of my favorites is pictured here: Jedi Boo and Sully.

For more details and stories from the show I recommend this coverage from [Coffee With Kenobi](https://www.jedinews.com/podcasts/articles/coffee-with-kenobi-782-3-d23-day-two-and-day-three/) where Dan chats with the team and provides audio coverage of the StageCraft presentation from the show floor.
