I've been enjoying producing and co-hosting [Lighter Darker: The ILM Podcast](https://www.ilm.com/lighterdarker/) with [Todd Vaziri](https://linktr.ee/tvaziri). We dive into the creative process of filmmaking and the art of visual storytelling. Shining on a light on the creatives behind the scenes has been a real blast and I'm very proud of the show we've created together.

If you're looking for a good episode to start with, I recommend our chat with acclaimed filmmaker [Lee Issac Chung and Producer Ashley Jay Sandberg where we dive into Twisters](https://www.ilm.com/lighterdarker/s1e4-twisters-with-lee-isaac-chung-and-ashley-jay-sandberg/), or the [Ultraman Episode with Shannon Tindle](https://www.ilm.com/lighterdarker/ep-006-ultraman-rising-with-shannon-tindle-and-hayden-jones/). 

You can subscribe on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lighter-darker-the-ilm-podcast/id1764351015), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0ovwtj5CICCmEdNUGa1dLO), or our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSdYxd2_srPWP3g1xKTp5ltICRr88dfut).

I hope you enjoy listening as much as we've enjoyed making it.
