I’m grateful to have been invited to speak at TED 2025 about the latest developments in filmmaking. My talk focused on Artist-Driven Innovation and a possible path forward for artists in this time of significant change. As technology rapidly transforms our industry, I wanted to share why the creative voice of the artist matters now more than ever.

## The Opening Shot That Changed Everything

The iconic opening shot of *Star Wars: Episode IV* didn’t just wow audiences--it redefined what was possible in visual storytelling of that era. Behind the scenes, it was the Dykstraflex motion control camera rig, a marvel of engineering, that made those dynamic moves possible. This was artist-driven innovation at its best: artists and engineers working side by side to create something entirely new.

## A New Era: AI and the Creative Collision

Today, we’re at another turning point with AI. Instead of being introduced to these new technologies with a spectacular opening shot of a movie, we're reading about them in the press. And the headlines aren’t very encouraging about the future of creative jobs. The technology is impressive, but it’s also intimidating, especially for those of us who’ve spent our entire careers crafting images frame by frame.

## Lessons from 50 Years at ILM

But we’ve been here before. At Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), George Lucas built a culture where artists and engineers work together to solve the biggest visual storytelling challenges. Looking back over 50 years, some of the biggest leaps forward – like the digital dinosaurs in *Jurassic Park* – happened when new technology was blended with the experienced artists. The “dinosaur input device” from that era literally combined stop-motion animation with computer graphics, allowing artists to animate in familiar ways while harnessing the brand new digital tools.

## Blending Old and New: Indiana Jones and The Mandalorian

This approach continues today. For *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny*, our artists combined hand-tuned AI models with full CG performances to de-age Harrison Ford, blending the best of both techniques and achieving a terrific level of quality. On *The Mandalorian*, we used real-time virtual production and massive LED walls to bring distant worlds to life, while still relying on classic techniques like stop-motion animation for certain shots—leaning on experienced artists to drive the newest techniques.

## Premiering "Field Guide": Exploring the Future of Creative Tools

What happens when the latest generative AI tools are placed directly in the hands of artists? Landis Fields, a talented artist at ILM, created this experimental short, *Field Guide*, in just two weeks as a way to imagine what a probe droid might encounter on a brand-new Star Wars planet. This is not a finished product but rather an early work-in-progress: think of it as a moving mood board that demonstrates what a show like this could feel like. By premiering this test at TED, I hoped to demonstrate how artist-driven innovation can shape the future of storytelling and how, even as technology evolves, it’s the creativity and vision of artists that truly bring these new worlds to life.

## The Power of Artist-Driven Innovation

As I wrapped up my talk, I reflected on that unforgettable opening shot from 1977-how it set a new standard for what cinema could be and inspired generations of artists and audiences alike. Artists need better tools – the current text prompts aren't a good way for talented artists to make movies. With a positive spirit of collaboration between artists and technologists, we have the chance to create moments that are even more imaginative, and more inspiring than that original Star Destroyer that inspired us all in 1977.
