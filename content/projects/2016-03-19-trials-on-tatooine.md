This week [ILMxLAB](http://www.ILMxLAB.com/) did the first public play test of *Trials on Tatooine* at the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) in San Francisco. *Trails on Tatooine* is a first-person story-based virtual reality experiment where you don a headset and get to walk around Tatooine, stand beneath the Millennium Falcon as in comes in for a landing nearly on your head, hear from Han Solo in the cockpit and eventually even defend yourself with a virtual lightsaber.

Working on this experience with the team at Lucasfilm has been a true highlight of my first two years at the organization and an amazing opportunity. Seeing everyone react so enthusiastically this week has been super rewarding. Here are a few of my favorite write-ups from the week:

[Time.com](http://time.com/4262173/star-wars-virtual-reality-vive/)

> “…you can practically smell the ozone wafting from its lethal light field.”

[Fortune](http://fortune.com/2016/03/15/htc-vive-star-wars-vr-experience-premieres-at-gdc/)

> “Star Wars Trials on Tatooine blends storytelling with video game mechanics, including lightsaber wielding, for a brand new way to experience Disney’s Star Wars universe.”

[io9](http://io9.gizmodo.com/a-brand-new-star-wars-vr-experience-put-me-on-tatooine-1764949047)

> “It was awesome–-and then I got to swing a lightsaber.”

[StarWars.com](http://www.starwars.com/news/step-inside-star-wars-talking-trials-on-tatooine-with-ilmxlabs-rob-bredow)

> “Lucasfilm’s next big foray into the future is here.”

I also got to meet Norman Chan from Tested.com, and we had a [detailed discussion](http://www.tested.com/starwars/565851-ilmxlab-star-wars-and-cinematic-storytelling-virtual-reality/) about the making of this experience and ILMxLAB’s other efforts in the space.

If this kind of work sounds like fun to you, [we’re hiring](http://jobs.lucasfilm.com/)!
