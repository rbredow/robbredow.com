My book, [*ILM Presents: **Making Solo** A Star Wars Story*](https://amzn.to/3RuXRgi) is out and I got to sit down with the team at [StarWars.com](https://www.starwars.com/news/rob-bredow-making-solo-book-interview) to chat a bit about the book.

Excerpts from the interview below...

“If you look at any of the other Star Wars movies that have been done, when you push those levers into hyperspace, as soon as the stars streak and it goes bright, we cut. In this movie, as soon as we go to hyperspace, it got really interesting and the camera operator, who in this case was Sylvaine Dufaux, she panned over and found Han’s face."  She could see the reflection of hyperspace caught in his eye, "like the perfect poetic way to illustrate the hopeful story point," Bredow says. "And we never would have thought of that shot had we not had that rear-projection screen wrapped around the cockpit.”

Bredow’s book highlights these serendipitous moments as well as learning experiences that come with pushing the envelope and sometimes failing.

>“I think it’s easy for us to forget that we learn more from things that don’t work than we learn from our successes,” Bredow says. “Going through here and documenting some of the stuff that we tried visually and we ruled out, I think that’s something that everybody benefits from."

> “The coaxium explosion is a real underwater explosion that we shot at high speed at 25,000 frames per second,” Bredow says. “That’s a camera that’s running about 1,000 times faster than your average camera. We set off a tiny little charge underwater. If you just looked at it with your eye, it looked like a white flash. But captured at very, very high speeds, you get this wonderful sphere that grows and then sucks back in and collapses on itself. Then you get the secondary flash and all the smoke that builds out. And we were really interested in capturing that and using that as the foundation for the coaxium explosion at the end of the train heist sequence.”

The complete book, [*ILM Presents: **Making Solo** A Star Wars Story*](https://amzn.to/3RuXRgi) is available on Amazon and other booksellers globally.
